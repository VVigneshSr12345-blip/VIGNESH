## General Information
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other real estate attributes.

- **Background**: Understanding real estate pricing is crucial for buyers, sellers, and investors. An accurate prediction model helps in making informed decisions.  
- **Business Problem**: The real estate market is dynamic, and pricing properties accurately remains a challenge. This project helps in estimating fair property prices based on historical data.  
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of real estate transactions, including attributes like square footage, number of bedrooms, year built, and neighborhood.  

## Conclusions
- House prices are significantly affected by location and neighborhood.  
- Larger homes with more rooms tend to have higher prices, but there are exceptions based on location and condition.  
- Certain features like the presence of a garage, basement, and renovations impact the property value.  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outlier detection, improves model accuracy.  

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models and evaluation  
- **XGBoost** - Advanced predictive modeling
