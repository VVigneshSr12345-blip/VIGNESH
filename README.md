# Telecom Churn Prediction

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Overview

Customer retention is a top priority in the highly competitive telecommunications industry, where customers frequently switch providers for better deals, improved services, or lower prices. This leads to **customer churn**, the rate at which customers leave a company.

To minimize churn, telecom companies must proactively retain customers, as acquiring new ones is significantly more expensive. Predicting churn enables providers to implement retention strategies, such as personalized offers, enhanced customer support, and service improvements, to maintain a loyal customer base.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom sector, driven by factors like poor service, competitive pricing, and dissatisfaction with overall experience. The industry typically experiences a churn rate of 15% to 25% annually.

Churn occurs in phases:
1. **Stable Phase**: The customer is satisfied and engaged.
2. **Transition Phase**: Signs of dissatisfaction emerge, such as exploring competitor offers or experiencing service issues.
3. **Churn Phase**: The customer decides to leave, making retention efforts ineffective.

Identifying customers in the transition phase is key to preventing churn. By tracking behavioral patterns, telecom providers can take timely actions to retain high-risk customers.

### 1.3 Project Objectives

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict telecom customer churn with the following objectives:
1. **Churn Prediction**: Identify customers at risk of leaving and implement targeted retention strategies.
2. **Key Churn Factors**: Determine the most influential factors driving churn, such as service quality, pricing, or customer engagement.
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights to reduce churn through personalized offers, improved service quality, and better customer support.
4. **Feature Optimization**: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle high-dimensional telecom datasets effectively.
5. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure business-aligned predictions.

### 1.4 Solution Approach

#### **Step 1: Data Understanding & Preparation**
- Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values, and transform variables for modeling.

#### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identify patterns, relationships, and outliers that influence churn.

#### **Step 3: Feature Engineering & Selection**
- Create new features and select the most relevant predictors while reducing noise.

#### **Step 4: Model Training & Evaluation**
- Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### **Step 5: Model Optimization**
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model efficiency and accuracy.

#### **Step 6: Churn Reduction Strategies**
- Implement data-driven strategies, such as personalized offers and targeted marketing campaigns, to reduce churn.

#### **Step 7: Submission File Creation**
- Generate a final output file with customer ID and churn probability for business implementation.

## 2. Project Objectives

The machine learning model aims to:
- **Identify High-Risk Customers**: Predict which customers are likely to churn and intervene early.
- **Determine Churn Drivers**: Analyze key factors influencing customer churn.
- **Enhance Retention Strategies**: Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer loyalty.
- **Optimize Model Performance**: Use evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision and recall, to focus on high-risk customers.

## 3. Tools and Techniques Used

- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, feature engineering

## 4. Conclusion

Predicting customer churn is essential for telecom companies to improve retention and reduce acquisition costs. This project demonstrates how machine learning models can identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights to mitigate churn.

By leveraging data-driven strategies, telecom providers can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce attrition, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.
